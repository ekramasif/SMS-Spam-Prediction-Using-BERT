# Multilingual SMS spam detection using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers

## Objective
> To develop an efficient translation-free recurrent neural architecture to  perform SMS spam detection which actually remembers the context of SMS.

This is based on the context of message rather than the contact numbers, from where SMS is arrived.
